	<p> My name is Alexandra i am twenty years old and currently attending my last semester at BMCC where i will graduate with my Associates in Multimedia Art & Design in Spring 2017. With all my work i look for inspiration from events in my surroundings as well as some of my own personal experiences. I love pieces with abstract shapes that deliver a clear message with little to no words. In most of my work i find myself having little to no text, I always try to minimalize it and focus more on the graphics and the positioning of everything. Next to the photograph of me, is the logo i have designed for myself thus far to represent me and my work. The eye symbolizes how i see the world and the events around me and within the eye is the background of earths layout. I believe most of my work is representation of me and how i view the world, it brings a new and fresh perspective to life! Some of the work came from assignments and some of it was done on my own free time. My work that i do on my own time is better in the sense that i have complete and total control over colors, positioning, and overall design choices. The advantage with work done for some of my college courses is there are limitations and expectations, it forces me to really think and be in a Client/Employer setting where goals and requirements have to be set. Enjoy, and please, any feedback is welcomed and Appreciated!</p>
